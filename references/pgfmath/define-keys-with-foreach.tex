% The foreach loop introduces a group and executes the contents 
% within that group. So the keys(which are actually macros) 
% survive until that group ends and vanishes after that. 
% The regular TikZ commands are executed immediately so this 
% doesn't cause a problem. Instead of hacking this behavior 
% you can introduce a global macro and accumulate your keys 
% inside that. Then outside the foreach you can set them all 
% at once.

% I used pgfmath instead of fp but that's not relevant.
